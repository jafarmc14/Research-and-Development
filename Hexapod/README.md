🐜 Hexapod Robot Project
This repository contains the design files, code, and documentation for a hexapod robot — a six-legged walking robot inspired by insect locomotion.

🔧 Project Overview
The hexapod robot is designed to demonstrate multi-legged walking mechanics, stability in motion, and basic autonomous behavior. This project combines mechanical design, electronics, and programming to build a functional robotic platform.

⚙️ Features
6 Legs with 3 DOF each (total of 18 servos)

STM32-based control system

Inverse kinematics for realistic walking gait

Basic autonomous navigation using ultrasonic sensors

Fire extingusher

🧠 Technologies Used
